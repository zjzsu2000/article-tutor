# Project Checkpoint

Last updated: 2026-06-04

## Current Status

- App: Article Tutor, an English reading tool for Chinese-native elementary and middle-school learners.
- Stack: Next.js 14 App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS.
- Deployment model: fully static export via `output: "export"` in `next.config.mjs`.
- Persistence: browser `localStorage` only.
- No backend, database, auth, API routes, middleware, or server runtime.
- Main features: topic cards, article reader, word and sentence lookup, saved vocabulary list, Web Speech API read-aloud, and Challenge UI.
- Challenge UI now supports randomized 3-question attempts with recent-question avoidance and grammar-style question types when available.
- Current human instruction wins over standing docs for the active session; otherwise future AI sessions should use `AGENTS.md` and this checkpoint as their starting guidance.
- Human approval is required before commit, push, or deploy.

## Last Completed Change

- v0.3.1 added grammar-style question types, per-attempt random selection, attempt persistence by question id, recent-question history, step dots, subtle quiz animation, and seed grammar questions for three articles.
- Current scaffold adds documentation for AI-agent workflow, review gating, project checkpointing, and lightweight task tracking.

## Known Issues

- Grammar-style questions are seeded only for a subset of articles; articles without grammar questions backfill attempts from available question types.
- Vocabulary auto-save on wrong quiz answers is planned but not implemented.
- TTS depends on browser Web Speech API support and may not work on all devices.
- The content set is small and should keep following the public-content copyright rule.

## Next Small Tasks

- Add grammar-style Challenge questions to the remaining articles, one or two articles per round.
- Add focused review prompts for new learner-facing content before merging.
- Improve Challenge-to-vocabulary flow, such as saving missed vocabulary questions, in a separate scoped round.
- Add a minimal manual QA checklist for mobile reading, quiz, and TTS behavior.
- Review whether `npm run lint` works reliably with the current Next.js version and document any known limitation.

## Verification Commands

Use the existing commands before claiming code changes are complete:

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
npm run build
npm run lint
```

For docs-only changes, at minimum inspect the changed files and run:

```bash
git diff --check
git status --short
```

Never mark a task complete just because code or docs were generated. Always report verification status and any review status or skipped checks.
